This repository houses files belonging to a research project that focuses on evaluating the use of enterprise knowledge graph plattforms for modeling digital twins of factories.
The research project was conducted by David Jilg and Nico Stuckart at the chair for Business Information Systems II at the University of Trier and supervised by Felix Theusch and
Prof. Dr. Ralph Bergmann.

The folder "Digital Twin - Rdf Export" contains the Digital Twin that was modeled in the enterprise knowledge graph platform i-views and exported in Rdf format. The folder contains
two versions. The version in the ".zip" archive contains all data objects resulting in a file size above githubs limit. The other version has a reduced number of data object but 
the strcuture of the digital twin is identical.

The folder "Asset Diagnostics" contains the Information that is referenced by the Digital Twin.
